# ðŸ“± Remote Control Android - Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Core Setup & Authentication
- [ ] Install required dependencies (Socket.IO, JWT, encryption, etc.)
- [ ] Setup authentication system with JWT
- [ ] Create login page with QR code generation
- [ ] Setup SQLite database for session management
- [ ] Create encryption utilities for secure communication

## Phase 2: Dashboard & Layout
- [ ] Create main dashboard layout with sidebar
- [ ] Build device list component with connection status
- [ ] Create device card component with quick actions
- [ ] Setup real-time connection status indicators
- [ ] Add navigation and routing structure

## Phase 3: WebSocket & Real-time Communication
- [ ] Setup Socket.IO server and client
- [ ] Create WebSocket connection management
- [ ] Build real-time communication hooks
- [ ] Implement device registration and pairing
- [ ] Add connection status monitoring

## Phase 4: Mock Android Device Simulator
- [ ] Create mock device data structures
- [ ] Build file system simulator with sample files
- [ ] Create mock app list and device info
- [ ] Generate mock screenshots and media files
- [ ] Setup GPS location simulator

## Phase 5: Remote Control Features
- [ ] **Screen Viewer**: Live screenshot display with auto-refresh
- [ ] **File Manager**: Browse, upload, download files
- [ ] **Command Terminal**: Execute commands with real-time output
- [ ] **App Manager**: List, install, uninstall applications
- [ ] **Device Info**: Display system specs and status
- [ ] **Location Tracker**: GPS tracking with map integration
- [ ] **Camera Viewer**: Remote camera access simulation
- [ ] **Audio Recorder**: Audio recording controls

## Phase 6: API Endpoints
- [ ] Authentication API routes
- [ ] Device management endpoints
- [ ] Screen capture API
- [ ] File operations API
- [ ] Command execution API
- [ ] App management API
- [ ] Location tracking API
- [ ] Media access APIs

## Phase 7: Security & Safety Features
- [ ] Implement AES encryption for sensitive data
- [ ] Add session timeout and security checks
- [ ] Create audit logging system
- [ ] Setup notification system (transparent alerts)
- [ ] Add device disconnect protection

## Phase 8: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] **API Testing**: Test all endpoints with curl commands
- [ ] **Real-time Testing**: Validate WebSocket connections
- [ ] **Security Testing**: Test authentication and encryption
- [ ] **UI Testing**: Test all dashboard features and responsive design
- [ ] **Integration Testing**: Test complete user workflows

## Phase 9: Build & Deployment
- [ ] Run production build with linting
- [ ] Start production server
- [ ] Generate preview URL for demo
- [ ] Final testing and documentation
